Weather Forecasting Project
Overview
This project is designed to forecast weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation using historical weather data. It includes data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and visualization using pie charts, bar charts, and line charts to showcase the results.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and process historical weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Weather Forecasting: Use machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, Linear Regression) to predict future weather conditions.
Visualization:
Pie Chart: Displays the distribution of different weather types (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Bar Chart: Compares temperature, humidity, or precipitation across different time intervals.
Line Chart: Visualizes weather trends over time (e.g., temperature variation throughout the day or week).
Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage
1. Data Preparation:
The input data should be placed in the data/ folder as a CSV file (weather_data.csv). The CSV should have the following columns:

Date/Time: Timestamp of the recorded weather
Temperature: Measured temperature
Humidity: Measured humidity levels
Weather Type: Type of weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
2. Running the Forecast:
Use the forecast.py script to perform the weather forecast and generate the visualizations:

bash
Copy code
python forecast.py
This script will:

Preprocess the weather data
Train a weather forecasting model (or load a pre-trained model from models/)
Forecast future weather conditions
Generate pie, bar, and line charts based on the data
3. Output:
Pie Chart: Displays the percentage of different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
Bar Chart: Shows a comparison of temperature, humidity, or precipitation over different periods.
Line Chart: Visualizes the forecasted weather trends over time.
All charts are saved in the charts/ directory for easy access and review.

Visualization Examples
Pie Chart: Illustrates the proportion of sunny, rainy, and cloudy days.
Bar Chart: Compares temperatures over a week or month.
Line Chart: Shows temperature, humidity, or precipitation trends over time.
